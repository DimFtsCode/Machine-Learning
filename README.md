Assignment 1: Derivatives and Optimization in Machine Learning
This assignment focuses on the fundamentals of optimization algorithms in machine learning. It contains three main tasks that require analytical and programming skills. Students must calculate derivatives for various functions, implement the gradient descent algorithm in Python, and evaluate its performance on given datasets. The goal is to develop a strong understanding of how optimization techniques, such as gradient descent, play a critical role in training machine learning models. The assignment also emphasizes the importance of documenting steps and ensuring reproducibility using tools like Jupyter Notebook.

Assignment 2: Music Genre Classification Using Neural Networks
This assignment involves building and training neural networks to classify music genres based on audio signal features. Students work with two types of representations: MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and mel-spectrograms. The assignment consists of designing and implementing feedforward and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch or TensorFlow. Students must optimize their models using techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and hyperparameter tuning. The project also includes real-world testing by making predictions on new music samples from YouTube, demonstrating the model's generalization capabilities.
